 
 This is a server side web application , designed with node, express and mongodb.
 This is a test of my ability to create CRUD API using express and mongoDB. Using them to efficiently interact with data on the database. 
 i created three different collections within the database( such as blogs, podcast and vlog). Then using mongodb querry i made efficient querring of the database. I also created MongoDB validation rules and ensured data consistency.

My api available routes includes
GET/
    GET/api
        GET/api/blog
        POST/api/blog
        GET/api/blog/:id
        PATCH/api/blog/:id
        DELETE/api/blog/:id

        GET/api/podcast
        POST/api/podcast
        GET/api/podcast/:id
        PATCH/api/podcast/:id
        DELETE/api/podcast/:id

         GET/api/vlog
        POST/api/vlog
        GET/api/vlog/:id
        PATCH/api/vlog/:id
